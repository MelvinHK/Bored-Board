Old CRUD study. Terrible React code.

In the future:
<ul>
  <li>
    Properly structure components in a top-down flow; don't cram many features into a single component. Use useContext more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use Node.js and MongoDB Atlas instead. It's free and has more customizable queries.
  </li>
</ul>

Simple message board site developed using React and Firebase.

  <li>Post comments, optionally attach an image</li>
  <li>Edit, delete comments you've posted</li>
  <li>Nested replies</li>
  <li>Collapse comments, copy their link</li>
  <li>Preview attached images on threads in thread lists</li>
  <li>Bottomless scrolling when browsing threads, comments</li>
</ul>

To Do:
